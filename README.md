# CapstoneProject
This is my Capstone Project for my class at Southwest Technical College. I decided that for this project I would teach myself enough HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a website within the alotted 45 hours for this project.  

This website is for small business that struggle with large inventory management. It uses custom QR codes to add to the inventory list saving workers time of going through inventory and gives business owner accurate information about their stock.    

This an image of the QR Scanner accessing and updating the inventory table.

This website uses a JavaScript API by [mebjas](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode) here on Github.  
I found the scanner through a YouTube Channel called [Phegon Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoAZQK1PmRM&t=71s) and they link the base of the scanner in the vidoe caption.
